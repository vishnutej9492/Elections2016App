# REQUIREMENTS:
The app is written using the Express web application framework, so you will need the following to run it:
-	NodeJS v0.8.14
-	Express v3.1.0
-	Jade 0.28.2
-	A server capable of running nodeJS.
-	A browser that supports HTML5.

I’ve included a copy of Express and Jade in the node_modules directory.

I am using the open source Chart.js graphing library, which I’ve included in public/javascripts.

To run the app, type ‘node app.js’.

‘http://localhost:3000’ to play with the app. Currently, you can vote multiple times by going back to this main page.
